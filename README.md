# 🔍 Visualize Activation Maps

## 📌 Introduction

This project aims to **visualize activation maps** from neural networks to better understand which input regions influence model predictions. By using techniques such as Grad-CAM, LRP, and saliency maps, we open the black box of deep learning models to make them more interpretable and trustworthy.

## 📚 Background

Deep learning models, especially CNNs, are powerful but often hard to interpret. Activation maps serve as a **lens into a model’s inner workings**, providing value in:

- 🔧 Debugging models
- ✅ Ensuring trust and reliability
- ⚖️ Regulatory compliance
- 🧠 Advancing research
